## Description

I created this project because I was inspired by this project by @ImBaedin on GitHub: https://www.braedin.com/FortniteRandomDrop/

I wanted to build off of his concept. The first thing that I wanted to add was the ability to make it so that you could generate a random POI instead of just a completely random location on the map. I often play with some of my friends, so it is more helpful to drop at a named location rather than a completely random point.

The program is simple to use. All you have to do is either click the "Generate Drop" button to generate a random POI drop, or click "Random Spot" to generate a completely random point.

## Getting Started

Go to [dropgenerator.com](https://dropgenerator.com)

### Technologies

-   This programs UI was built using HTML and CSS and the program itsself was built in Javascript.

## Help

One thing to note is that you will need to press the "C" button after running a calculation to clear the screen before typing another equation.

## Authors

- @Tweagan11 implemented the completely random location generator, and also helped with the debugging for this project. Huge thanks to him.
